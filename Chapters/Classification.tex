While classification is only a single part of the CloudAssure system, all
operations hinge off its categorization decision. Classification is currently an
very active area of research \autocite{Zhang2000}, expecially with respect to
internet documents. Classification is a branch of machine learning which
attempts to predict the underlying topic, or classification of a given document.
As a discipline under machine learning it's helpful to describe machine learning
at a high level, before describing the classification techniqus evaluated and
finally implemented in CloudAssure

\section{Machine Learning with Respect to Classification}

In ``Probabilistic Topic Models'', Blei describes the Latent Dirichlet
Allocation and its probabilistic approach to topic prediction
\autocite{Blei2012}.

\subsection{Bayesian Inference}

\subsection{Decision Trees}

\subsection{Support Vector Machines}
\autocite{Chang2011}
The Classification System thusly
needs to be properly trained for the best performance. The Classifier has two
possible algorithms available. Depending on the implementor's dataset, one will
offer more accurate results.

The Classifier, should provide a statically significant improvemnet over simply
guessing the category. For instance, if the dataset contains 4 categories, then
random chance will classify a document in the correct category 25\% of the time.
To be useful, our classifier must do more accurate job than this. With our
demonstration dataset, the Bayesian classifier scored 82.54\% accurate,
and the Decision Tree classifier scored 86.87\% accurate.

\section{Implementation}
Our implementation is divided into two parts: A Direct Implementation, and
a second implementation utilizing nltk
	- What nltk actually does
	- Compare initial naïve version with the high performance nltk version
	- Walk through how the implementation works.

\subsection{Implementor Workflow}
	- Describe the IT implementor workflow
		? Obtain sufficiently classified data
		? Build the database
			§ Document selection needs to be done carefully. Adding poor data will decrease the precision of the qualifier
		? Build the model (Choose an algorithm) 
			§ Tree model for 3695 documents took 75 minutes (0.868741542625 accurate)
			§ Bayes model for 3695 documents took 3 minutes (0.8254 accurate)
		? Use the classifier and the model to classify new documents

\subsection{Security Concerns}
It is critically important that the .plk file be stored in a secure place, or be
cryptographically secured and verified prior to each load. The .plk file if
manipulated by a maleficent agent can be used to subvert the trust system and
classify data into anyfor category of the agent's choosing.
